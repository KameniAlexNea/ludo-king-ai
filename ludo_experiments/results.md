‚úÖ **Consistently outperforms all scripted strategies** (37.5-40.5% win rate vs 25% random baseline)  
‚úÖ **Strongest against weak opponents** (46% vs random strategies)  
‚úÖ **Competitive vs elite scripted AI** (39% vs BALANCED - still 14% advantage)  
‚úÖ **Robust across different opponent configurations**

### 3.2 Training Insights
- **PPO_LUDO_FINAL** (curriculum vs scripted): Shows superior performance across all test scenarios
- **PPO_SELF_PLAY** variant: Provides training diversity but scripted curriculum proves more effective
- **BALANCED** emerges as the strongest scripted opponent for curriculum learning
- **PROBABILISTIC_V3** confirms as appropriate weak baseline for early training
- Mixed curriculum approach demonstrates successful strategy generalization

### 3.3 Next Development Priorities
1. **Curriculum Evolution**: Graduate from PROBABILISTIC_V3 to BALANCED/CAUTIOUS opponents
2. **Self-Play Integration**: Implement periodic frozen checkpoints to reduce non-stationarity  
3. **End-Game Optimization**: Add finishing bonuses to reduce average game length
4. **Robustness Testing**: Evaluate temperature-scaled policy sampling for overfitting detection
5. **Phase-Specific Analysis**: Implement early/late game performance metrics
