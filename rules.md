## **GAME SETUP**

* **Players:** 2-4 players, each choosing a color (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)
* **Board:** Cross-shaped board with a path of colored squares
* **Pieces:** Each player gets 4 tokens/pieces
* **Starting Position:** All 4 tokens begin in their colored "home" area
* **Equipment:** One six-sided die

## **OBJECTIVE**

Be the first player to move all 4 tokens around the board and into your colored "home column" in the center.

## **BASIC GAMEPLAY**

### **Starting the Game:**

* Players take turns rolling the die
* To move a token OUT of home onto the starting square, you must roll a **6**
* Rolling a 6 gives you an extra turn
* If you can't move any pieces, your turn ends

### **Moving Tokens:**

* Move tokens clockwise around the outer path
* Move the exact number of spaces shown on the die
* You can choose which of your tokens to move (if multiple are in play)

## **DETAILED RULES**

### **Rolling a 6:**

* Get another turn immediately
* If you roll three 6's in a row, your turn ends immediately
* Use a 6 to either bring out a new token OR move an existing token 6 spaces

### **Capturing Opponents:**

* If your token lands on a square occupied by an opponent's token, you "capture" it
* The captured token returns to that player's home area
* You get an extra turn when you capture an opponent
* **Exception:** Safe squares (marked with a star â˜…) - tokens cannot be captured here

### **Safe Squares:**

* Colored squares matching your color are safe for your tokens
* Star-marked squares are safe for all players
* Multiple tokens can occupy safe squares

### **Entering Home Column:**

* After completing the outer circuit, tokens enter your colored home column
* You must roll the EXACT number to enter each square of the home column
* Tokens in the home column cannot be captured

### **Winning:**

* First player to get all 4 tokens into the home column wins
* Tokens must reach the center triangle by exact count

## **SPECIAL RULES**

### **Stacking:**

* Two or more of your own tokens can occupy the same square
* Stacked tokens move together as a group
* Stacked tokens cannot be captured

### **Blocking:**

* If you have tokens stacked on a non-safe square, opponents cannot pass through

### **Extra Turns:**

* Rolling a 6 = extra turn
* Capturing an opponent = extra turn
* Getting a token "home" to the center = extra turn

## **STRATEGY TIPS**

* Balance between bringing out new tokens and advancing existing ones
* Use safe squares strategically
* Try to capture opponents near their home to set them back significantly
* Sometimes it's better to move a token closer to home rather than bringing out a new one

The game combines luck (dice rolling) with strategy (choosing which pieces to move), making it engaging for players of all ages!
